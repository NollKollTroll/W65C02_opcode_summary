# W65C02 opcode summary

This is my own version of a W65C02 opcode summary, with most of the timings verified on my own HW.

## General info

When I started coding on the W65C02 I found several documents regarding the opcodes with timing info. There were however several discrepancies between the documents, and it was really hard to know which info was correct.
This is my combination of the documents I've found, along with the verification info I gathered on my DIY hardware.
